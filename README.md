# Neuro-RPS Repository

Welcome to the **Neuro-RPS** GitHub repository! This repository features well-commented code for the comprehensive analysis and detailed results of the Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) project.

## Code Structure

### `binom`

The `binom` file contains code for calculating the required accuracy using the binomial distribution. It includes visualization of the binomial distribution and provides insights into the necessary accuracy to meet a specific success rate.

### `MakeFeatureTable`

The `MakeFeatureTable` file includes code by Professor Sam Michalka for creating a feature table from Electromyography (EMG) data. It extracts features such as variance, mean absolute value, and root mean squared, enabling standardized processing of training and test data.

### `rpsanalysis`

The `rpsanalysis` file encompasses code for the analysis and classification of RPS data. It involves offline classification from extracted features, k-fold cross-validation, and the creation of a final classifier for predicting on both training and test data.

## Usage

To navigate through the code and analyses, follow these steps:

1. **`binom`**: Explore the code for binomial distribution calculations and visualizations.

2. **`MakeFeatureTable`**: Understand how features are extracted from EMG data and organized into a feature table.

3. **`rpsanalysis`**: Examine the code for offline classification, k-fold cross-validation, and building the final classifier.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuro-rps.git

2. Open MATLAB or Octave.
3. Navigate to the src folder.
4. Execute the desired scripts based on your analysis requirements.
